# TidyData- Project
## Summary
For the TidyData Project, I followed Hadley Wickham's three [Tidy Data Principles](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) using data from the U.S. Federal Research and Development (R&D) Budgets. This tidy data project contains descriptions, instructions, and visualizations.

## Data

This data is pulled from **jonthegeek**'s [Federal Research and Development Spending by Agency] (https://pages.github.com/). The cleaned data set contains four variables, which include...

``Budget``: Research and Development in inflation-adjusted US dollars

``Department``: US Agency/Department
<details>

</details>

``GDP``: Total US Gross Domestic Product in inflation-adjusted US dollars 

``Year``: Fiscal Year


## Instructions
First, download the Federal R&D Budget dataset in the ``data`` folder.

After downloading, open a Jupyter Notebook.

Then, import the following libraries:

``pandas`` for data wrangling

``seaborn`` for visualizations

``matplotlib.pyplot`` for visualizations

Run the coding block and you are set to explore the data!

## Cleaning Process 🫧
To clean this dataset according to the three [Tidy Data Principles](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) we must...

**First, have each variable in its own column**. This means that variables such as "Department", "Budget", "Year", and "GDP" must be labeled at the top of the dataset.

**Second, have each observation in its own row**. This is the result of one treatment on one person.

**Third, have each type of observational form a table**. Good ordering makes it easier to scan raw values.

## Vizualizations

This line plot demonstrates how each department's budget changed over time. The Department of Defense (DOD) receives the most money each year.

This bar chart demonstrates the year-to-year budget allocated to all departments. The total budget has steadily increased each year, although it has generally decreased since 2011.
