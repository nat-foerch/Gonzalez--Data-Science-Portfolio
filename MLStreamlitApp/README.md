# MLStreamlit App: Interactive Supervised Machine Learning 📈
## Project Overview 
This streamlit app allows users to explore data using machine learning models. In the app, you will find features that allow you to upload your dataset and customize its features to visualize data in a simple way. You can also experiment with different hyperparameters to see how the model's performance changes. This app is a fun and easy way to train and explore your data!

##  How to Run This Project 🏃🏻‍♀️‍➡️
### Check if you have imported Streamlit and installed the required libraries and packages!
- matplotlib==3.10.1
- numpy==2.2.4
- pandas==2.2.3
- scikit_learn==1.6.1
- seaborn==0.13.2
- streamlit

### Two Ways To Access The App:

1. Click this [link](https://foerchml.streamlit.app/)

2. Download the [MLStreamlit App code](https://github.com/nat-foerch/Gonzalez--Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/MLStreamlitApp/MLStreamlitApp.py) within the MLStreamlitApp folder in the Gonzalez-Data_Science-Protfolio.Then open VS Code, upload the .py file, and type "streamlit run MLSteamlitApp.py". The app will deploy in a different browser.
