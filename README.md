# Gonzalez--Data-Science-Portfolio
- This is my first repository which will be used to organize future projects this Spring semester of 2025.
- I will include folders for EDA, visualizations, and other models.
- This repository was created while enrolled in Intro To Data Science at Notre Dame. Taught by [David M Smiley](https://dmsmiley.github.io/).

Hello there! Check out my Tidy Data Project! This project is all about the cleaning process of a Federal Research and Development Dataset. I apply Hadley Wickham's three [Tidy Data Principles](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) to prepare this dataset for statistical analysis and visualizations. By clicking the link above, you will be directed to my Tidy Data folder so that you can learn how to apply these principles. I applied these principles and created visualizations that include comparisons like budget vs departments. My last project walked through how to develop a streamlit app using a cleaned data set. If you click on the [streamlit link](https://github.com/nat-foerch/Gonzalez--Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit-app), you can learn how to create an app. In this project, I focus on how to clean messy data sets. I can now develop a Streamlit app with my cleaned dataset.
